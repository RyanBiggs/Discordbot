Discord bot

I've wanted to build a Discord bot for a while. I know Javascript a little and don't know python at all, so as an excuse to build something using them both I decided to playaround with discord.js and discord.py to build a discord bot.

Currently both versions just do some random stuff, it really is just a project for me to play around with post-uni. 

I do find discord.js to be a bit more fun and robust in comparison to its python counterpart so you may find that the js bot has more functionality. 

My current todo list:

1) Play youtube audio in chat - take a youtube link and play the audio in chat, potentially adding a search function to show 5 relevant links from a search term.

2) Add a coinflip feature

3) Gif search - essentially a gif keyboard but using a discord bot

4) !!!! Really need to add a help feature to list commands
